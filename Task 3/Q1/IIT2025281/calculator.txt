A calculator is an electronic device or software application designed to perform mathematical computations with speed and accuracy. Ranging from basic handheld units that handle simple arithmetic—such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—to complex scientific and graphing models capable of solving calculus problems and plotting data, these tools have become essential in education and professional fields. While originally mechanical, modern calculators are predominantly digital and are now ubiquitous, often integrated directly into smartphones and computers to assist with everything from daily budgeting to advanced engineering equations.
